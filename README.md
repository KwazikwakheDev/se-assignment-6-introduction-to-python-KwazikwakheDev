# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

   - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability, which makes it accessible to both beginners and experienced developers.
   - Python is easy to read,write and it is interpreted language.
   - The language is dynamically typed and support multiple pradigms.
   - Python can be used for web development, data science and Machine learning.
   - Its can also be used for Software Development and Game development.


2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

   Windows:
   - Download Python installer from www.python.com
   - Run the installer and select "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
   - Click "Install Now" and Python will be installed.

   macOS:
   - Install Homebrew if not already installed: /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   - Install Python using Homebrew: brew install python.

   Linux(Ubuntu/Debian):
   - Open terminal and update package list: sudo apt update.
   - Install Python: sudo apt install python3.

   Verifying Installations:
   - Open terminal or command prompt.
   - Type python --version or python3 --version.
   - Verify the Python version displayed matches the installed version.

   Setting Up a Virtual Environment
   Using venv which is built in module in Python 3
   - Open terminal or command prompt.
   - Create a new directory for your project: mkdir myproject && cd myproject.
   - Create a virtual environment in windows use the command python -m venv env.
   - In macOs/Linux a command python3 -m venv env..


3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
    
    - print("Hello, World!")
    - The print() function in Python is used to output data to the console. Here, it prints the string "Hello, World!"
    -In Python, strings are sequences of characters enclosed in either single ' or double " quotes. They represent textual data and can include letters, numbers, and special characters.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

   - Python Supports several basic data types which include:
   - Integer (int): Whole numbers without any decimal point.
   - Float (float): Numbers that have a decimal point or use scientific notation.
   - String (str): Ordered sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
   - Boolean (bool): Represents truth values True or False.
   - NoneType (None): Represents the absence of a value or a null value.
   <pre>
   '''python
         # Integer variable
             num1 = 42

         # Float variable
             num2 = 3.14
         # String variable
              message = "Hello, Python!"

         # Boolean variables
             is_python_fun = True
            is_learning = False

         # NoneType variable
           nothing_here = None
   
   '''

   </pre>


5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
